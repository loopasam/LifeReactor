{"name":"Life Reactor","body":"**Ever wondered about the origin of life?**\r\n\r\nSo did [Alan Turing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing),\twell-known scientist for his achievements in computer science and artificial intelligence. In 1951, he published an article, [The\tChemical Basis of Morphogenesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chemical_Basis_of_Morphogenesis), in which he describes the spontaneous formation of patterns arising from chaotic molecular systems.\r\n\r\nThis browser-based experiment (designed for Chromium) celebrates the centenary of his birth and shows the formation of these patterns: How unorganized molecules can spontaneously  give rise to stable oscillating structures (automata), simply by interacting and diffusing (via brownian motion here).\r\n\r\nIt is argued that such patterns are essential for biological morphogenesis. They may also be related to animal coats, skin pigmentation and neural networks.\r\n\r\nAnd why not, to the origin of life on Earth.\r\n\r\nIt takes a little while for the patterns to appear. Fiddle the parameters around till it reaches the form of life you like, but don't put too many or too big molecules in the reactor, otherwise your browser will freeze.\r\n\r\nMore info on the theory and source code: [github wiki](https://github.com/loopasam/LifeReactor/wiki)","tagline":"turing 2012: an origin of life","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

Introduction:

Ever wondered about the origin of life?

So did Alan Turing (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing),
well-known scientist for his achievements in computer science and artificial intelligence.

In 1951, he published an article, The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chemical_Basis_of_Morphogenesis),
in which he describes the spontaneous formation of patterns arising from chaotic molecular systems.  

This browser-based experiment celebrates the centenary of his birth
and shows the formation of these patterns: How unorganized molecules can spontaneously  give rise to stable oscillating structures, simply by interacting and diffusing (brownian motion here).

It is argued that such patterns are essential for biological morphogenesis. They may also be related to animal coats, skin pigmentation and neural networks.

And why not, to the origin of life on Earth.
